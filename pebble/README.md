# pebble

O(sqrt(T)) checkpoint management using the Red-Blue Pebble Game algorithm.

## Features

- **O(sqrt(T)) space** - Bounded memory with sqrt(T) checkpoints
- **O(sqrt(T)) replay** - Reconstruct any state in at most sqrt(T) operations
- **no_std by default** - Works in embedded environments (requires `alloc`)
- **Pluggable storage** - Abstract over flash, disk, or custom backends
- **Warm recovery** - Rediscover surviving checkpoints and rebuild the DAG automatically

## Usage

Implement `Checkpointable` and `CheckpointSerializer` for your type, then pass them to `PebbleManager` or use the builder ([example](examples/basic.rs)).

## How It Works

Pebble implements the Red-Blue Pebble Game, a model for space-time tradeoffs in computation:

```
Events:      [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ... [100]
                  |           |           |            |
Checkpoints:     [2]         [5]         [8]         [10]
                  |           |           |            |
             Red pebble  Red pebble  Blue pebble   Red pebble
             (in memory) (in memory) (serialized)  (in memory)
```

**Red pebbles** are checkpoints in fast memory — instant access, bounded space. **Blue pebbles** are checkpoints in storage — requires I/O, unbounded space. The algorithm automatically decides which to keep and which to evict.

## Strategies

| Strategy | Space | I/O Bound | Use Case |
|----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| `TreeStrategy` | O(sqrt(T)) | 2-approximation | Tree-shaped dependencies |
| `DAGStrategy` | O(sqrt(T)) | 3x budget | General DAGs |

## Feature Flags

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `verdict` | `Actionable` error impls for retry integration |
| `bytecast` | Zero-copy `BytecastSerializer` adapter |

Pebble implements the Red-Blue Pebble Game model from Hong & Kung (1981), using leaf-count 2-approximation results from Gleinig & Hoefler (2022) for tree eviction. The sqrt(T) space bound is motivated by recent breakthroughs in space-efficient simulation.
